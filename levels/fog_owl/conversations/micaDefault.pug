        How did that get in there?! It's true, but my career was short and not 
        all that successful. My most famous role was as an anthropomorphic fruit.
        I performed a memorable song and dance number impressing upon children the 
        importance of eating five servings of fruits and vegetables a day.<br/><br/>
        So if you're ever on a mission where you need someone to pretend they're 
        an apple, I've got you covered.

        Oh, sure - I'm Mica, your communications officer aboard the Fog Owl. In 
        addition to being fluent in several languages, I can help if you need to 
        conduct negotiations or handle sensitive conversations with any people 
        you meet while exploring The Cloud.
