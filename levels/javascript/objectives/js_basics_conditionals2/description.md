# What Else?

In this objective, we'll learn a bit more about **conditional** statements! Sometimes, its useful to run logic only if another conditional failed. For this purpose we use the `else` statement.

We're going to create a function called `spellNumber`. It will take in an integer 1-9 and return a string of the number's name. So `1` in would return `"one"` and `2` would return `"two"`. If an input isn't a integer from 1-9 the function should return `"other"`.

When you've written a function as described, click the _HACK_ button to validate your work.
