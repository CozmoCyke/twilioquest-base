# Hello, Operator

In this objective, you will write a program that uses **operators** to modify some of the data types we learned about in the previous mission.

Open the **code editor** and read through the example code. This tutorial will focus on the **arithmetic operators** in JavaScript. These challenges will revolve around the Number data type you learned about. These operations are similar to the basic math you might do with a calculator.

Create variables using the operators as instructed, then click the _HACK_ button to validate your work.
