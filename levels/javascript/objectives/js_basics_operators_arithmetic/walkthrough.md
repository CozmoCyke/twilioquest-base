# Arithmetic

Storing data is pretty useful, but in order to start having our programs help us we need to tell them what to do. We can tell a program what to do with something called an **operator.** In this lesson we'll talk about arthimetic operators like addition and substraction.

## Do the math!

We're going to cover the following operators, you've probably seen most of them on a calculator before:

- Addition `+`
- Subtraction `-`
- Division `/`
- Multiplication `*`
- Remainder `%`

Using an operator in a program is a lot like using them in a math expression. In math you might write something like this to use the addition operation:

```
2 + 5 = 7
```

In JavaScript we're going to do almost the same thing. Except, we're going to save the result of our math problem into a variable called `sum`.

```js
let sum = 2 + 5;
```

Now we've done the math 2 + 5 and saved it into a variable named `sum`. So `sum` now contains the value of `7`.

## Completing this hack attempt

To complete this challenge, we're going to create one variable for each of the different arithmetic operations.

- `sum` for the addition operator `+`
- `difference` for the subtraction operator `-`
- `product` for the multiplication operator `*`
- `quotient` for the division operator `/`
- `remainder` for the remainder operator `%`

Each variable must be **named and initialized exactly**. Double-check your spelling!

Once you have declared each of the variables in your code, in a way that conforms to the instructions above, click the _HACK_ button to receive your reward.
