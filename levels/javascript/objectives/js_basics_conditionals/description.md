# On One Condition

In this objective, you will write a function that uses a **conditional** statement to run different pieces of logic based on its inputs. A conditional statement will only run the code it contains if the expression passed into it true.

We're going to create a function called `safeDouble`. It should take one argument and return twice the value of that number. If the inputs are NOT numbers it should return nothing instead. The **code editor** has been preloaded with the function declaration - you just need to make it do something useful!

Create a function which doubles one number and uses `return` to pass back the result. Then click the _HACK_ button to validate your work.
