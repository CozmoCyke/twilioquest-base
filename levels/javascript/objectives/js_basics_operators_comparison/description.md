# One Thing is not Like the Other

In this objective, you will write a function that makes use of the **comparison** operators. Comparison operators allow you to compare two operands and decide whether an expression is `true` or `false`. For example: `6 < 10` evaluates to `true` while `8 === 'string'` evalutes to `false`.

We're going to create some functions that ensure their inputs are the proper datatypes. Create and export a few functions:

- `isPositive` -> use the comparison operators to ensure a number is positive
- `isInteger` -> use the remainder operator and the equality operator to determine if an input is a whole number or not
- `isNumber` -> use the built in function isNaN and the negation operator to create a function that tells us if an input is a number

These functions have been declared in the **code editor** already, you need to make the functions works!

Create the 3 functions, then click the _HACK_ button to validate your work.
