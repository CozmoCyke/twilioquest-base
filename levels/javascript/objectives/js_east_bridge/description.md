# Unlock This Door With Booleans

Create a new JavaScript file in your JavaScript workspace directory `<%= env.TQ_JAVASCRIPT_WORKSPACE_PATH.value %>` called `hackDoor.js`.

In that file create a boolean variable called `isDoorLocked` and have it set to `false` so that you can hack your way into the Scientist's office.
