# Over and Over Again

In this objective, you will write a function that uses a **loop** to run the same block of code multiple times.

We're going to create a function called `power`. This function will raise the first input (the base) [to the power](http://www.math.com/school/subject2/lessons/S2U2L2DP.html) provided by the second input. A power function in mathematics looks like `2 ^ 3 = 8`. This function is equivalent to `2 * 2 * 2 = 8`.

Our power function will take two arguments. The first argument is the `base` we'll be raising. The second argument is the number of times we will multiply the base number, or our function's `power`. The **code editor** has been preloaded with the function declaration, but it will be up to you to write the code inside it.
