## How do I compare two things?

We use something called operators to compare two different values in JavaScript. JavaScript.info has some [detailed information to get you up to speed on how operators work](https://javascript.info/operators).

> We know many operators from school. They are things like addition +, multiplication \*, subtraction -, and so on.

We want to make use of Comparison Operators, not mathematical operators though!

The Mozilla Developer Network has [in depth information about how comparison operators work](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators).

In general, we'll prefer to use the strict equality operator `===` instead of the normal equality operator `==`. Learn some more about [the potential pitfalls with the normal equality operator](https://codeburst.io/javascript-double-equals-vs-triple-equals-61d4ce5a121a) on Codeburst.io.

## Starter Code

When you opened this objective, TwilioQuest should have created a file for you to hack this barrier with.

The file should have been created in your JavaScript Workspace directory at: `<%= env.TQ_JAVASCRIPT_WORKSPACE_PATH.value %>/isTreeAlive.js`.

It should have the following contents:

```js
// This is what your variable declaration should look like in your
// separate isTreeAlive.js file!

function isTreeAlive(treeType) {
  if () {

  } else {

  }
}

// These are your test cases! You don't need to mess with them!
//
// They call your function with various inputs and print them
// out to your console when you run this file with Node.js
console.log(isTreeAlive(0));
console.log(isTreeAlive(1));
console.log(isTreeAlive(2));
console.log(isTreeAlive(3));
```

If you want to start over, just copy and paste the above code over top of your current code!
