# JavaScript: An Unlikely Hero
Even those that love JavaScript (such as your friends on Team TwilioQuest) know how [weird it can be](https://wtfjs.com/). Yet despite all its... charm... JavaScript has become the [lingua franca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca) of software development. Read on to learn more about the origin of JavaScript, and why it might be the only programming language you ever need to learn.

<summary>Like Gen Z, it was born on the web</summary>

In 1995, JavaScript [began its life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#History) as the programming language of the web browser. Before JavaScript, web pages were pretty lifeless once your browser fetched and displayed them on your computer screen. With JavaScript, website creators could make their web pages more interactive and dynamic. The web apps you love today, like Gmail, Slack, and Twitch, have been built using JavaScript.

<summary>Like hot sauce, it's great on everything</summary>

You might be aware that the browsing the Internet has become relatively popular. That has made JavaScript, the programming language of the web browser, an essential tool for any programmer that needs to write code for users on the Internet. The success of the web, more than the beauty of the language, made JavaScript a programming language that a huge number software developers share in common.

Today, JavaScript runs everywhere, not just in the web browser. You can make games with [Phaser](https://phaser.io/), build an iPhone app with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), create a backend work horse with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), or even control a [Misty II robot](https://docs.mistyrobotics.com/) like your buddy Cedric. If you know how to write JavaScript, you can program just about anything.

If you only learn one programming language, JavaScript is a pretty solid choice. Though we hope you go on to learn many programming languages besides.
